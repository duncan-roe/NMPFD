# NMPFD
Nice Manual Pages From Doxygen
## Overview
**NMPFD** was developed to make nice man pages for library functions written in C.<br>
Its main component is the postprocessor shell script `build_man.sh` (hereafter referred to as *build_man*).<br>
*build_man* does require some extra Doxygen `\manonly` code in the source files.
